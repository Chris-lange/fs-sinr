# fs-sinr
Code for "Feedforward Few-shot Species Range Estimation", published at ICML 2025.

We will very shortly be uploading code in this repository to train and evaluate FS-SINR models, as well as visualize the estimated ranges produced. We will also provide code to generate the training and evaluation datasets.
